<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/982697573028626432/984985755287953458/unknown.png?width=769&height=676)

Websites such as Shoppee or Lazada are massively successful commercial websites for selling and buying products. Our apps apply the same design for a different field: Tourism. 

Our app aims to give users and travel agencies a medium to communicate. Make it easier too book trips, view tour summaries, leave reviews for other users as a traveler and give postings, introduce your travel plans and help customers as a traveling agency.
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Motivation

We chose to develop this website to learn more skills about the MERN stack architecture and have a clean, useful, intuitive website for users. It has core skills for webapps such as CRUD functionality, authentication and authorization, commercial website capabilities like reviews, rating, searching, tags,... 

With all these functions, which tests the skills we learned during the course and is in demand in the market we decided to create this website for the Web Application Development course.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Implementation

### Technology Choice
- Programming language:
  - JavaScript: The most versatile and widely used programming language when it comes to web programming, has a big communitity and well documented. So it's easy to research popular architectures and design and find help in the development process.
  - HTML/CSS: Primary markup language for websites and styling in all browsers and platforms.

- <b>MERN stack architecture</b>:
  - MongoDB: A lightweight and flexible database using NoSQL design system. It allows for rapid development and modifications on the fly.
  - ExpressJS: Backend system for NodeJS that allows for fullstack integration with other plugins and MongoDB database.
  - ReactJS: One of the most popular webapp framework developed by Facebook with massive community and tutorials.
  - NodeJS: Run JavaScript locally on the terminal instead of the browser and npm which gives access to many useful packages for webapp development.

Why chose the MERN stack ?
![mernstac](https://webimages.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/mern-stack-b9q1kbudz0.png?auto=format%2Ccompress)

- MERN is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).
- The combination means that JSON data flows naturally from front to back, making it fast to build on and reasonably simple to debug. Plus, you only have to know one programming language, and the JSON document structure, to understand the whole system!
- MERN is the stack of choice for today‚Äôs web developers looking to move quickly, while still having a reliable, strong security and feature-set.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Front End Implementation

Mostly concerned with ReactJS and CSS styling.

1. Styling:

  - UI Package: [Material UI Core](https://mui.com/core/)

Material UI Core is a library that allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications. This saves a significant amount of time since the developers do not need to write everything from scratch.

The package includes many pre-configured HTML elements with professional and sleek styling for components like text box and grids.
  - Design Concept:
  
![SiteUI](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/982697573028626432/984986304221679646/unknown.png?width=865&height=676)

The styling of the site is similar to Shoppee where Posts are aligned as grids with the most important info like names, likedUsers, Agency is displayed and user can click these posts to get into the detailed view.

![Detailed-view](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/982697573028626432/984986718983843901/unknown.png?width=870&height=676)

In the details view Tourist can see information about the Tour. Users can rate, leave comments on the tour, see tour dates, locations, ect...

![You-Might-Also-Like](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/982697573028626432/984987090347515934/unknown.png?width=785&height=676)
There is also the "You might also like" section to give recommendations about Tours the user might like.


1. Event handling and responsiveness:

A powerful tool in ReactJS are Hooks which simplifies React states and data. With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. 

   - UseState hook:

Use state hooks lets us declair variables and a function to set that variable in the webapp's runtime. This let us store and manage site state which persists throughout the website. [Read the Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

<hr>

   - UseEffect hook:

The UseEffect hook accepts a callback function and an array of variables. The function is called when a variable passed in is changed. You can pass in an empty array of variable to run the function on load.
<hr>

Along with some other ReactJS and Redux hooks like UseDispatch, UseStyles, UseSelector,... the site is dynamic and responsive with web design techniques such as AJAX, dynamic loading, requests and JavaScript event handling.



### Back End Implementation

Mostly concerned with ExpressJS and mongoDB 

1. Database Setup:

We use mongoDB, a NoSQL database so there is no need for relational database design.
   - [Mongoose Package](https://c.tenor.com/2XVhxkbhzMcAAAAd/nikocado-bailando.gif)

Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

Example schema for Tour Posting:
```
{
  title: String,
  message: String, 
  name: String,
  creator: String,
  tags: [String],
  selectedFile: String,
  comments: { type: [String], default: [] },
  likedUsers:{
    type: [String],
    default: []
  },
  createdAt:{
    type: Date,
    default: new Date()
  }
}
```

2. Backend REST API:

The Front End sends requests dynamically to the back end and gets the requested data back in JSON format. More detailed explaination in the Diagrams section. 

Example frontend request:
```
GET http://localhost:5000/posts
```
This HTTP Request asks the server for all the postings in the database.

Example backend reply:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 126485
ETag: W/"1ee15-S7T9gwSlo7rLFD7W8aBnqBztImU"
Date: Sun, 05 Jun 2022 08:17:52 GMT
Connection: close

[
  {
    "_id": "6263fe5481698ed4ccf76af3",
    "title": "WELCOME",
    "message": "HIIII",
    "name": "Tester",
    "creator": "62a1a33f53a48464702aaf89",
    "tags": [
      "ayo"
    ],
    "selectedFile": "data:image/jpeg;base64,",
    "likedUsers": [],
    "createdAt": "2022-05-20T07:41:01.464Z",
    "__v": 0
  }
]
```

Server returns an array of JSON objects containing the posting information.


In summary: Frontend sends HTTP Requests to the server and the server queries the database and returns the requested data. Other operations such as editing, deleting, searching also follow the same process.





### Challenges
   - Although professional assets were used, the design still looks "amateur". 
   - Unfamiliarity with ReactJS lead to messy coding, long time spent reading code and refactoring.
   - Code unorganization makes it difficult to implement new features.
   -  Utilizing deprecated packages and features makes it difficult to find resources and documentation.
   -  Time managementment and task allocation.

### What we learned

During the development of this project we learned about:
   - MERN stack Architecture

## Diagrams

1. Usecase Diagram:

![UsecaseDiagram](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/982697573028626432/982939317762678834/unknown.png?width=651&height=676)

The main usecases for the website:
- Login/Logout
- Create Tour Posting
- Register to Tour




1. Sequence Diagrams:

  - **Login**:

    - Prerequisite:
      - User must have a created account.
      - Server and database is running.

![Login-Sequence](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/982697573028626432/982950549605453884/unknown.png)

**Notice**: User passwords are encrypted in the database. The validation process compares the hashed password only. The clients also encrypts the password before sending the HTTP request so this login method ensures security for users.

The Sequence Diagram is similar with the Google login feature. Replace the Server and Database with Google API.
